# Project Clock/Game

## Project Overview
This project is an unfinished C++ application built with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). 
The initial idea was to create a clock/game with a dynamic layout system. 
Although the project didn't reach completion due to lack of direction, one notable achievement was the development of a robust layout system that allows the application to scale properly to any screen size.
Might reuse or iterate on the ideas explored here in later projects.
